Problem Scenario 59 : You have been given below code snippet. 
val x = sc.parallelize(1 to 20) 
val y = sc.parallelize(10 to 30) 
operation 1 
z.collect 
Write a correct code snippet tor operation1 which will produce desired output, shown below. 
Array[Int] = Array(16, 12, 20, 13, 17, 14, 18, 10, 19, 15, 11) 
Solution : 
val z = x.intersection(y) 
intersection : Retürns the elements in the two RDDS which are the same.
